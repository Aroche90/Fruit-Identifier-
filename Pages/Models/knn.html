          <p>First off, I need to give credit to the domain www.pyimagesearch.com, whose code and explanations really helped me
          to understand machine learning, and how to convert images into arrays that make sense. However, that being said, k-Nearest
          Neighbor is not a model that I would recommend for classifying images in the future.</p>
          <p>To convert the images from the Kaggle dataset into arrays that could be evaluated, first I used Python to calculate the 
          R,G & B values for each image. Obviously, this needed to be in a loop in order to process each image. After looping the files, 
          I sent them through 2 functions: the first flattened the images, and the second turned each of the R, G & B values between 0
          (black) and 256 (white) into a histogram. An example of what this looked like is listed below.</p>
          <p>After putting the histograms together, the model attempted to train itself based on images that followed a similar histogram
          pattern for each input element. This is where the trouble started to set in: an image with approx. a third white space in the 
          background is going to be skewed towards the high values of each of the R, G & B elements. Unfortunately, as these were the 
          highest numbers for each image, the computer struggled to identify these fruits correctly.</p>
          <p>In order to combat these struggles, I sorted the dataset down to just 2 fruits: White Grapes (actually green), and Black/Red 
          Cherries. I chose these two because the hue variation between them was highest, and they were a similar size and shape. 
          The second aspect that I (attempted) to add in was to mask a portion of each picture. Ideally, this would
          eliminate all of the white space, focusing only on the R, G & B values for each fruit. However, aligning the mask turned out to be 
          much more difficult than it appeared, as the values are assigned similarly to image spots in d3. Therefore, I ended up abandoning
          my attempts at a more successful model.</p>

           <p>To the far right is the arg parse code, and to the right is 
           where you input your file bath via the build tool. I found this to
           be incredibly helpful if you are running one function on multiple 
           sets of data, or even just testing your function over and over 
           again because you chose to simplify your dataset. I highly 
           recommend looking into the documentation online.</p>
